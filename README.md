## Methodology

The dataset was generated through a comprehensive modeling and optimization pipeline involving the following steps:

1. **Dynamic Wave Modeling**:
   - Simulations were performed using the XBeach Non-Hydrostatic (XBNH) model to compute wave runup and overtopping under diverse storm wave conditions.
   - Wave scenarios are based on synthetic hurricane datasets tailored for the New Jersey coast, including peak wave periods (`Tp`) ranging from 4 to 14.7 seconds and significant wave heights (`Hs`) up to 4.6 meters.

2. **Data-Driven Model**:
   - A symbolic regression-based surrogate model (Gene Expression Programming, GEP) was trained on XBNH outputs.
   - The model captures complex relationships between wave parameters, design features, and performance metrics.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Multi-objective optimization using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II).
   - Objectives:
     - Minimize project total cost.
     - Maximize wave robustness and flood serviceability.
   - Constraints:
     - Maximum seawall height: 1.29 m
     - Vegetation area: Up to 36 m²
     - Vegetation density: Up to 500 stems/m²
